# ESDRRA-IoT_Data
The datasets are randomly generated, based on a first-order autoregression model(AR(1)), for 500 IoT devices to represent temperature data (18C to 32C) by the Cooja simulator operating on Contiki 2.7 operating system. The structure of each file consists of three columns, as follows:
1- The date of data generation
2- The time of data generation
3- The temperature values
